# 📚 EduSpark – One-Stop Career & Education Advisor  

### 🌟 Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Project by Team Sparkup  

EduSpark is a **bilingual (English + Hindi)** web platform designed to help students (especially in Jammu & Kashmir) make informed academic and career decisions.  
It bridges the awareness gap by providing **personalized guidance** through quizzes, career mapping, government college directories, and real-time notifications.

## 🚀 Problem Statement  

Most students and parents in India lack awareness about:  
- Which stream (**Arts, Commerce, Science**) to choose after Class 10/12.  
- What **degree courses** government colleges offer.  
- What **career opportunities** each course leads to.  
- Whether pursuing **graduation is worth it** compared to short-term courses.  

This leads to poor academic choices, dropouts, or migration to expensive private colleges.
